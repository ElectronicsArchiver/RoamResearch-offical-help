- But I think I can give a kind of argument that might be convincing. The source code of the Viaweb editor was probably about 20-25% [macros](<macros.md>). Macros are harder to write than ordinary [Lisp](<Lisp.md>)

- But I think I can give a kind of argument that might be convincing. The source code of the Viaweb editor was probably about 20-25% [macros](<macros.md>). Macros are harder to write than ordinary [Lisp](<Lisp.md>) functions, and it's considered to be bad style to use them when they're not necessary. So every macro in that code is there because it has to be. What that means is that at least 20-25% of the code in this program is doing things that you can't easily do in any other language. However skeptical the Blub programmer might be about my claims for the mysterious powers of [Lisp](<Lisp.md>),
