    - Notes on "Version 2 "
        - Seeing a situation where what I want to do is reuse a collection of things attached to an attribute and have that attribute apply to the new thing
            - {{embed: ((ECwiXThsJ))}}
                - The problem right now - conceptually - is that when I block ref something - I've been defaulting to thinking about referencing the LINK -- like - the whole connection between "[Thoughts and Ideas](<Thoughts and Ideas.md>)" and that set of people
                    -  What I'm looking for in this "Version 2 " example is the ability to not just [REFERENCE]([Block References](<Block References.md>)) the attribute, but to reuse the relationship - in terms of the data structure
        - 12:03 -
            - can still view this whole thing as a table - but have to change the original thing to render the table layout
                - or would have to block-ref each individual item to add the whole table to the top - which wouldn't be reactive
                    - Would be nice if you could pass block-embed into something and have it actually treat it exactly the same way as if the items underneath were direct children of that block
