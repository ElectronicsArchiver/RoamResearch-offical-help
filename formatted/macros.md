## [Beating the Averages](<Beating the Averages.md>)
- The five languages that Eric Raymond recommends to hackers fall at various points on the power continuum. Where they fall relative to one another is a sensitive topic. What I will say is that I think Lisp is at the top. And to support this claim I'll tell you about one of the things I find missing when I look at the other four languages. How can you get anything done in them, I think, without [macros](<macros.md>)?

- Many languages have something called a macro. But Lisp [macros](<macros.md>)

- If you understand how compilers work, what's really going on is not so much that Lisp has a strange syntax as that Lisp has no syntax. You write programs in the parse trees that get generated within the compiler when other languages are parsed. But these parse trees are fully accessible to your programs. You can write programs that manipulate them. In Lisp, these programs are called [macros](<macros.md>).

- Programs that write programs? When would you ever want to do that? Not very often, if you think in Cobol. All the time, if you think in Lisp. It would be convenient here if I could give an example of a powerful macro, and say there! how about that? But if I did, it would just look like gibberish to someone who didn't know Lisp; there isn't room here to explain everything you'd need to know to understand what it meant. In [Ansi Common Lisp](http://paulgraham.com/acl.html) I tried to move things along as fast as I could, and even so I didn't get to [macros](<macros.md>)

- But I think I can give a kind of argument that might be convincing. The source code of the Viaweb editor was probably about 20-25% [macros](<macros.md>).

- Ordinarily technology changes fast. But programming languages are different: programming languages are not just technology, but what programmers think in. They're half technology and half religion.[6] And so the median language, meaning whatever language the median programmer uses, moves as slow as an iceberg. Garbage collection, introduced by Lisp in about 1960, is now widely considered to be a good thing. Runtime typing, ditto, is growing in popularity. Lexical closures, introduced by Lisp in the early 1970s, are now, just barely, on the radar screen. [macros](<macros.md>),

- [5] It is a bit misleading to treat [macros](<macros.md>)
