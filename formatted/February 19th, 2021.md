                        - Query for it
                            - {{[query](<query.md>): {and: [DONE](<DONE.md>) [.Falsified](<.Falsified.md>)}}}

.grey-hl .rm-highlight {
  background-color: transparent;
  color: gray;
}
```"
            - And ^^this^^ is big #.big
                - "```css
.big .rm-highlight {
  background-color: transparent;
  font-size: 2em;
}```"
