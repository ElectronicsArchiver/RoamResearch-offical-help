- # [Data Loss Risk](<Data Loss Risk.md>)
    - We've now had a few reports of people losing data when merging pages (usually they're changing a page title and getting a "this page exists would you like to merge" and the page does not in fact exist)
        - Working on identifying this bug, but if you get the [Merge Pages](<Merge Pages.md>) warning, suggest copy/pasting that text to an external source first.
