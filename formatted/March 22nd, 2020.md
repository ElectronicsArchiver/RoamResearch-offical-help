    - Live stream of this is here https://youtu.be/ZLSPKigWNZo
    - "23:47 -- 00:06" only took 20 minutes to get setup
    - If it is simple to stream, and it can get saved directly to youtube - which we'll test right now - then this is totally worth it, as it could dramatically increase the number of tutorial videos we could be making.
    - 00:09 - 00:11
        - Looks like the video got there right away

    - Two places I can think to start seeding this into a properly organized [Zettelkasten](<Zettelkasten.md>)
        - First is to start to pull in some of the notes from [Andy Matuschak](<Andy Matuschak.md>)
            - but with that - need to figure out how I want to differentiate his notes from my own
            - [Matt Brockwell: A Taxonomy of Notes](<Matt Brockwell: A Taxonomy of Notes.md>)
        - 02:12 - 02:20
            - Found the link in "[Matt Brockwell: A Taxonomy of Notes](<Matt Brockwell: A Taxonomy of Notes.md>)"
                - https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_note-writing_as_fundamental_unit_of_knowledge_work
            - The prototype is much more readable - but it is interesting that it feels much less of a space for these scattered half developed thoughts
                - Even his least developed stubs are worthy of presentation - whereas these are much more obviously public scratchings
            - I'm feeling highly skeptical of the ida of just importing them wholesale
                - Seems more apt to put them in under at least a heading of the author

        - I totally now want an easy way to do the following
            - The title of the page should possibly be able to respect whatever namespacing convention we have set up
                - I like the idea of naming the title of the page - when importing a content - based on the domain that it has come in from
                    - Though - when we have the idea that nodes (today called pages) - can have more than just a string attached to them
    - 02:37 - 02:40
        - Playing around with naming convention for [[[*](<[[*.md>) Note Writing as Fundamental Unit of Knowledge Work]]
            - I could imagine doing something like writing writing out a proper Zettlekasten this way
                - Writing it without adding pages yet
                    - 1. [The way you format your note titles in Roam matters](<The way you format your note titles in Roam matters.md>)
                        - [1a Renaming a note in Roam should be done so that it appears in different autocomplete](<1a Renaming a note in Roam should be done so that it appears in different autocomplete.md>)
                    - [3 Changing the name of a note in Roam doesn't matter all that much](<3 Changing the name of a note in Roam doesn't matter all that much.md>)
                    - [March 23rd, 2020](<March 23rd, 2020.md>)

        - I definitely like the idea of numbering my permanent notes now - as it will make it easier to reference them associatively 
            - **[Trade-Offs](<Trade-Offs.md>):** 
                - **[Benefits](<Benefits.md>):** You could Mark a note by its number even if you don't have a great title for it yet #[Z/1/Questions matter more than answers](<Z/1/Questions matter more than answers.md>)
                - **[Weaknesses](<Weaknesses.md>):** If you try to choose the right name for a few notes at the same time - or you are going back and forth on them - like I am with [The way you format your note titles in Roam matters](<The way you format your note titles in Roam matters.md>) - then you have to either - not have written anything yet
    - 03:01 -- 03:04
        - A path for eliciting more of my notes for a zettelkasten 
            - **[steps](<steps.md>):** 
                - Look for [Key Terms](<Key Terms.md>)
                - look through everything in [Questions](<Questions.md>)
    - 03:04
        - need to exercise

    - High level Version 1
        - Point B
        - Point A
        - "Point C"
        - This is a new phrasing [*](((XIlWZ1AOr)))
