- Example
    - Flight BA1234 arrived at London Heathrow... on 12-Dec-05... at 10:25 am
    - The first link has Flight BA1234 as its source, arrived at as its verb and London Heathrow as its target. The second link has the first link as its source, on as its verb and the item 12-Dec-05 as its target. (A link that begins with an ellipsis "..." has the previous link as its source.) The third link has the second link as its source, at as its verb and 10:25 am as its target.
    - Here is an alternative way to write the same thing using parentheses:((Flight BA1234 arrived at London Heathrow) on 12-Dec-05) at 10:25 am
