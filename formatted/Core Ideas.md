- Used to be a big R&D guy for apple, now runs his own R&D lab, all of the things he builds are designed to demonstate a powerful idea, and hopefully influence what the maker community makes. One of my favorite thinkers, and an archetypal activist-inventor.  Small details in the presentation of his papers make his work even more delightful. For instance, he makes it possible to hyperlink to specific paragraphs in MagicInk, or 'skim' a long talk in Media for Thinking the Unthinkable. He does in his presentation of ideas all the things I wished we could have done at HuffPostLabs.

- Founder of YC, I've read every one of his essays. He is seriously fucking onto something, also fact that he has now, via YC helped create 3 $Billion+ companies doesn't hurt as proof point
