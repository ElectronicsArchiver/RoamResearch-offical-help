It wasn't just as consumers that the [big companies](<big companies.md>) made us similar. They did as employers too. Within companies there were powerful forces pushing people toward a single model of how to look and act. IBM was particularly notorious for this, but they were only a little more extreme than other [big companies](<big companies.md>).

As well as pushing [income](<income.md>)s up from the bottom, by overpaying unions, the [big companies](<big companies.md>)

To some extent this was an illusion. Much of the de facto pay of executives never showed up on their [income](<income.md>) tax returns, because it took the form of perks. The higher the rate of [income](<income.md>) tax, the more pressure there was to pay employees upstream of it. (In the UK, where taxes were even higher than in the US, companies would even pay their kids' private school tuitions.) One of the most valuable things the [big companies](<big companies.md>)

One of the most valuable things the [big companies](<big companies.md>) of the mid 20th century gave their employees was job security, and this too didn't show up in tax returns or [income](<income.md>) statistics. So the nature of employment in these organizations tended to yield falsely low numbers about economic inequality. But even accounting for that, the [big companies](<big companies.md>)

The ultimate way to get market price is to work for yourself, by starting your own company. That seems obvious to any ambitious person now. But in the mid 20th century it was an alien concept.

By the 1970s, no one stopped to wonder where the big prestigious companies had come from in the first place. It seemed like they'd always been there, like the chemical elements. And indeed, there was a double wall between ambitious kids in the 20th century and the origins of the big companies. Many of the [big companies](<big companies.md>)

Basically, Apple bumped IBM and then Microsoft stole its wallet. That sort of thing did not happen to [big companies](<big companies.md>)
