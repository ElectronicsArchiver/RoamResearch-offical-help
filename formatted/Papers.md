- Used to be at Yale, now runs Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law. Called as the expert witness by the defense in Bradley (now Chelsea) Manning. Probably the academic that is most widely known and read by internet people. Probably the closest thing I have to a Karl Marx. Looking through his latest papers I realize there is a lot he has written about that I haven't read and should. He writes a ton about the Public Sphere, Broadband, Connectivity, Democracy, IP, Copyright.  Plenty to disagree with, but he's a great place to start.
