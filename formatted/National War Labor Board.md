## [The Refragmentation](<The Refragmentation.md>)
The effects of [World War II](<World War II.md>) were both economic and social. Economically, it decreased variation in [income](<income.md>). Like all modern armed forces, [America](<America.md>)'s were socialist economically. "From each according to his ability {{comment-button}}", to each according to his need. More or less. Higher ranking members of the military got more (as higher ranking members of socialist societies always do), but what they got was fixed according to their rank. And the flattening effect wasn't limited to those under arms, because the US economy was conscripted too. Between 1942 and 1945 all wages were set by the [National War Labor Board](<National War Labor Board.md>).
