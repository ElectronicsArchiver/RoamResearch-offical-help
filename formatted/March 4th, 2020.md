    - Very strange that daily notes have come out of order in the help database
        - My guess is this is something to do with someone accessing Roam with a weird clock time change on their computer
        - Need to figure this out

                - Control-O and Control-Shift-O are probably the most important key commands in Roam (for my usage)
                    - but there is no way right now for people to discover them
                    - And if you do not know about Control-O, there is no way for you to move focus from a sidebar block into the main area
                        - [ ] Have a right click option for -- jump to this block that appears so that people can click it [April 28th, 2020](<April 28th, 2020.md>) 
                        - [ ] when people do a task that has a key-command attached fire something that alerts them to - this has a keyboard shortcut
