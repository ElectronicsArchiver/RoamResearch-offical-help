- Whenever I have a meeting, I tend to create a bullet point on my daily note file with a structure like this
    - 17:52 -- 18:30  (38 minutes)
        - [Meeting](<Meeting.md>) with [Tiago Forte](<Tiago Forte.md>) and [William Eden](<William Eden.md>)
            - Note -- this is a fake meeting
            - Discussion about [Time Management](<Time Management.md>)
                - Will thinks best book is [Eat That Frog](<Eat That Frog.md>)
                - Tiago is a fan of [GTD](<GTD.md>)
        -  `I track how much time I'm spending on things roughly by using "current time" `
