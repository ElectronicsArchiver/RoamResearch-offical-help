- I've noticed that this framework in particular [Pareto Principle](<Pareto Principle.md>) -- [Collaborative Explore-Exploit](<Collaborative Explore-Exploit.md>) has really shaped my worldview and directed my work. Also though, just noticing the impact of this [Thought Algorithm](<Thought Algorithm.md>)

- Which is to say -- the belief in thought algorithms (in general) lead me to pay particular attention to ones that look promising, and these have (I believe) pretty fundamentally shaped who I am (and how I interact with the world).  But as I said -- this "belief" in [Thought Algorithm](<Thought Algorithm.md>)s

- I looked at what we were trying to do (and the pattern of [Thought Algorithm](<Thought Algorithm.md>)s

- I found, what I perceived and perceive to be the 20% that produced highest gains -- datalog, and then found experts in that community -- provided value to them by connecting them to each other -- and giving them a [Thought Algorithm](<Thought Algorithm.md>)

- Should be able to specify up front a [Thought Algorithm](<Thought Algorithm.md>)

- Noticed that it was now over a year ago that I drafted a [Tweet Storm](<Tweet Storm.md>) about [Thought Algorithm](<Thought Algorithm.md>)s
