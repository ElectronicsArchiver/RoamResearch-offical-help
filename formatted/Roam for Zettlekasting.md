The [Zettelkasten](<Zettelkasten.md>) is basically the [GTD](<GTD.md>) for Intellectual Progress
    - It makes the unpredictable work of creative insight into a habit -- and makes it much much easier to write papers
        - Actually has a lot in common with [Just in Time Project Management](<Just in Time Project Management.md>) from [Tiago Forte](<Tiago Forte.md>)
            - Particularly the idea of [Intermediate Packets](<Intermediate Packets.md>)
                - "Instead of delivering one big lump of value at the very end, you stage your progress in a series of short, intense sprints, ending each one with a tangible, intermediate deliverable, like a set of notes, a brainstorm, a series of examples, an outline, a prototype, or a draft." 
                - "![](https://i1.wp.com/praxis.fortelabs.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/168-175.001.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&ssl=1) "
                - The core idea in the [Zettelkasten](<Zettelkasten.md>) is that every time you read something worthwhile, you write up each idea in your own words -- and link those ideas to the other notes that are related
                - When you're writing research papers or blog-posts you should never be starting with a blank page -- you instead want to just pull on a "thread" and have a whole stream of thoughts -- already written in complete sentences, in your own words, to build off of
                    - [ ] Include link on threads from [Visakan V](<Visakan V.md>)'s twitter
                - Especially if you're doing a lot of interdisciplinary work, or if a lot of your work builds off similar ideas, these small chunks may be useful over and over again
                - "![](https://i0.wp.com/praxis.fortelabs.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/168-175.006.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&ssl=1)"
    - I've tweeted a lot about it here

Most of the people I know who follow the [Zettelkasten](<Zettelkasten.md>) process find existing writing / notes tools pretttttyyy limiting

Roam is different
    - Roam was designed from the ground up to support the [linking](<linking.md>) [threading](<threading.md>) [collecting](<collecting.md>) and [structuring](<structuring.md>) of ideas necessary to make [Zettelkasten](<Zettelkasten.md>) really efficient.
        - How?
            - Well, rather than re-write the content -- I'll just embed the welcome email I wrote earlier today below
                - Note -- if you click on the little counter to the right side of this, you'll see the original context [hide](<hide.md>) 
                - {{embed: ((1233))}}
