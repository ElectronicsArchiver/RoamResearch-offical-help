- As I build my sleep notes little by little, I might eventually be ready to title a page something like this: **[Sleep is a process-state, during which vital neurophysiological housekeeping processes occur](<Sleep is a process-state, during which vital neurophysiological housekeeping processes occur.md>)*

- For example, in my own writing about sleep, I might find that **[Sleep is a process-state, during which vital neurophysiological housekeeping processes occur](<Sleep is a process-state, during which vital neurophysiological housekeeping processes occur.md>)
