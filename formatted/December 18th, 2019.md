    - Need to sleep, but thinking about creating some examples of using Roam to create a [Dependency Graph](<Dependency Graph.md>) of [Modular Lessons](<Modular Lessons.md>) for [Education](<Education.md>)
    - Things to think about
        - Interactive problem sets
            - definitely the kind of thing you could build in through extensions once we open up the API
        - Tracking how far through the course a student has moved
            - both for [Instructor Analytics](<Instructor Analytics.md>) and for [Tracking Progress](<Tracking Progress.md>) so the student knows what to read or do next
                - this could easily be factored into the [Graph Overview](<Graph Overview.md>)
- Evening
    - Mapping a knowledge graph
        - Intro classes
            - [1](<1.md>)
            - [A](<A.md>)
            - [X](<X.md>)
    - Model map
        - - 
            - Nesting means it comes after 
            - #[tags](<tags.md>) used to show additional dependencies from other parts of tree
        - [1](<1.md>)
            - [1.1](<1.1.md>)
                - #[A](<A.md>)
                    - [1.1.A](<1.1.A.md>)
                - #[X](<X.md>)
                    - [1.1X](<1.1X.md>)
                        - [1.1.X1](<1.1.X1.md>)
                            - #[1.1.A](<1.1.A.md>) #[1.2X](<1.2X.md>)
                                - [1.1.X1-1.1.A-1.2X.1](<1.1.X1-1.1.A-1.2X.1.md>)
            - [1.2](<1.2.md>)
                - #[X](<X.md>)
                    - [1.2X](<1.2X.md>)
        - [A](<A.md>)
        - [X](<X.md>)

    - This is a simpler problem than a truth graph
        - Because
            - In a knowledge graph there is only one sort of dependency 
                - Is the thing required for the next thing
                    - If it isnt, remove it as a dependency 
                - Did the student complete the material?
                    -  If they did, add it to the completed attribute for them and they select the next module. 
        - This could work fractal-ly 
            - Any problem broken down into sub components 
                - Used as specifically ingredients for other problems 
                - So you start w
                    - A = Broad subject 
                        - Geometry 
                    - Or A = Subproblem 
                        - Specific proof or axiom from Euclid 
    - How to track students
        - Student A
            - **[Level](<Level.md>):** [1.1.A](<1.1.A.md>)
            - **[Completed](<Completed.md>):** [A](<A.md>) [1](<1.md>) [1.1](<1.1.md>) 
        - Student B
            - **[Level](<Level.md>):** [1.2X](<1.2X.md>)
            - **[Completed](<Completed.md>):** [1](<1.md>) [X](<X.md>) [1.2](<1.2.md>)

    - Checking truth claims is more difficult 
        - You still have a graph 
            - however you also factor in
                - X --> Y is itself a claim that can be evaluated - and differ for each person.
                    - IF BOB SAW HIM SHOOT THE GUN HE SHOT the president 
                        - I can think bob is lying 
                            - If Bob says he saw him shoot the gun, then Bob saw him shoot the gun
                                - Is possibly implied claim 
                        - I can think the gun had blanks 
                        - I can think there were multiple shooters, and Bob shot someone else.
                - You want to map certainly of a claim, and certainty of relationships.
                    - !X -> B
                        - **[Certainty](<Certainty.md>):** {{[slider](<slider.md>)}}
        - You want a way of deferring evaluations of expert level claims to people you trust on a topic.
            - Evaluating claims is tricky work
            - Arguing for claims is too
            - There is no reason to do it if the things you're working through aren't reusable and worth the effort
                - It makes sense to lay out a proof in
                    - Mathematics 
                        - Proofs are the game 
                    - Highly consequential decisions
                        - Legal arguments 
                        - Big money decisions based on logical models of the world
                            - Like hedge fund decisions.
                            - Large expenses for an individual.
                    - Places where convincing someone who is skeptical, but amenable to rational argument is worthwhile.
                        - Crowdsourcing != wikipedia
                            - More likely to be github 
                                - You want canonical representation of a person or group's understanding of an argument.
                                - Coming to agreement is like pull requests on another person's mind.
                        - Important to know debate rarely changes minds, mostly to help the undecided onlookers
