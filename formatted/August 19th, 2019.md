    - The most important [Features](<Features.md>) that [Roam](<Roam.md>) has which other team knowledge bases don't are
        - [Bidirectional Links](<Bidirectional Links.md>)
            - see [Mentions](<Mentions.md>)
        - [Precise Links](<Precise Links.md>)
            - see "Going Meta" or "Roam for [Research](<Research.md>)"
        - [Embedding Content Across Pages](<Embedding Content Across Pages.md>)
    - All of those are really important if you don't want to end up with your notes stuck in disconnected [Silos](<Silos.md>) 
        - Or if you want to make sure -- when you're considering a topic/project, you can see all your teammates notes on the subject -- regardless of where they wrote things down.
    - Example of how your workflow is different if you use Roam vs other tool
        - In any other tool -- like [Notion](<Notion.md>) -- you might have a lot of different kinds of notes
            - for example
                - You might have meeting notes, organized by day
                - You have notes about projects you're working
                - You have notes about the other people or organizations you're working with
                    - Who works where or with whom
                - You might have open questions you're trying to solve at work
                    - A paper you're trying to write
                    - A product you're designing or building
                - You might have notes from books or articles you're reading
            - In a tool like Notion, those things are separated by default
            - If you want to connect things together -- you have to create a whole bunch of databases for each type of note, and figure out one set of relationships for how all those things connect
                - This means you that if you want to avoid silos -- you have to know ahead of time how you want your different databases to be connected, and follow a pretty rigid structure for writing things down
                    - Roam solves this nicely with [Precise Links](<Precise Links.md>) and [Bidirectional Links](<Bidirectional Links.md>)
        - With Roam if you have notes of all those types from "for example"
            - When you have a meeting with a person, all you need to remember is to create a link for that person's name.
                - We suggest just making a bullet point like "[Meeting](<Meeting.md>) with [Tiago Forte](<Tiago Forte.md>) and [William Eden](<William Eden.md>)" and writing the notes for that meeting under that heading
                    - Now you'll have a page for every person in the meeting
                    - You can easily see all the notes you've ever taken from meetings with them -- or meetings where their name came up -- or any other content about them.
                - If during the meeting they mention a concept you can just create a link or tag for that concept  
                - If the meeting has an action item -- you can add a [task](<task.md>) right there
                - you can take your notes for that meeting in the daily notes page -- or on the page for the project you're working on -- or under that person's page -- it doesn't matter. 
                - Because of [Bidirectional Links](<Bidirectional Links.md>) -- just by referencing a page, you're collecting all the notes you write on that page
                - So now you can filter all your meeting notes with a particular person to only find the things they said that were relevant to Concept X or Project Y
