- definitely should name each of the verse links with their full proper name -- as that is what they are most likely going to appear as when copy/pasted -- though this is a great case for the [Aliases](<Aliases.md>)

## [December 3rd, 2020](<December 3rd, 2020.md>)
- [ ] The parser is recursive - it can handle [Nested [[Links](<Nested [[Links.md>)]] and ^^**bold highlights**^^ and `[html roam]([Aliases](<Aliases.md>))

## [Roam Change Log](<Roam Change Log.md>)
- [alias]([Aliases](<Aliases.md>))

- [alias]([Aliases](<Aliases.md>)) [work]([Aliases](<Aliases.md>))
