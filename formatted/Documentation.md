## [Mermaid Diagrams](<Mermaid Diagrams.md>)
- Note -- it does not play nicely with other features of Roam -- like [Block References](<Block References.md>) or [Bidirectional Links](<Bidirectional Links.md>) - if you want to have the elements of you diagram be links you can click - or to include images or other richly formatted blocks - use the native Roam [Diagrams](<Diagrams.md>) which are also more **point and click interactive**
