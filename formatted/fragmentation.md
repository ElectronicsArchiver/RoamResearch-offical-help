## [The Refragmentation](<The Refragmentation.md>)
One advantage of being old is that you can see change happen in your lifetime. A lot of the change I've seen is [fragmentation](<fragmentation.md>).

Version 1 of the national economy consisted of a few big blocks whose relationships were negotiated in back rooms by a handful of executives, politicians, regulators, and labor leaders. Version 2 was higher resolution: there were more companies, of more different sizes, making more different things, and their relationships changed faster. In this world there were still plenty of back room negotiations, but more was left to market forces. Which further accelerated the [fragmentation](<fragmentation.md>).

Obviously the spread of computing power was a precondition for the rise of startups. I suspect it was for most of what happened in finance too. But was it a precondition for globalization or the LBO wave? I don't know, but I wouldn't discount the possibility. It may be that the re[fragmentation](<fragmentation.md>)

If we think 20th century cohesion disappeared because of few policy tweaks, we'll be deluded into thinking we can get it back (minus the bad parts, somehow) with a few countertweaks. And then we'll waste our time trying to eliminate [fragmentation](<fragmentation.md>),
