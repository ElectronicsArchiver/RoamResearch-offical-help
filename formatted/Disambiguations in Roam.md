- Recently I was asked
    - If I have a [Tree](<Tree.md>) how does it know if I'm talking about (the plant) vs (the datastructure)?  I watched a bunch of your videos, but I dind't seem to catch if it has that as a feature -> context sensitive terminology.
    - There are two ways you could solve {{alias: ((2589)) this}} problem
        - The first is to simply create a tag for the context before you do any writing, and then make use of filters
            - For example
                - [Datastructures](<Datastructures.md>)
                    - An idented list often represents a [Tree](<Tree.md>) 
                    - a [Tree](<Tree.md>) is a widely used [abstract data type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type) (ADT)—or [data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure) implementing this ADT—that simulates a hierarchical [tree structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_structure), with a root value and subtrees of children with a [parent node](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)), represented as a set of linked [nodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(computer_science)).
                - [Ecology](<Ecology.md>)
                    - [Tree](<Tree.md>)s are a great way of creating shade to make a place more livable
            - If I follow that, then I can have one page for [Tree](<Tree.md>) and in the mentions filter for the things which relate to Datastructure or Ecology, depending on the context I'm thinking of
        - Another option is to use [Namespaced Pages](<Namespaced Pages.md>)
            - In Roam, if you have things you have two pages that you want to keep seperate, but have the same name, you can put a / in the name -- the prefix will be hidden 
                - [Datastructures/Tree](<Datastructures/Tree.md>)s are much more commonly used for organizing notes that [Datastructures/Graphs](<Datastructures/Graphs.md>), but they are far less powerful
                    - See -- [A City is Not A Tree](<A City is Not A Tree.md>) by [Christopher Alexander](<Christopher Alexander.md>)
                - I love climbing [Plants/Tree](<Plants/Tree.md>)s
                - (you can toggle how much of the prefix of you are showing at any time by hitting `control-c control-l`) -- see [Keyboard Shortcuts](<Keyboard Shortcuts.md>)
