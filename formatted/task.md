## [As We May Think](<As We May Think.md>)
- As Director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, Dr. Vannevar Bush has coordinated the activities of some six thousand leading American scientists in the application of science to warfare. In this significant article he holds up an incentive for scientists when the fighting has ceased. He urges that men of science should then turn to the massive [task](<task.md>)

- The historian, with a vast chronological account of a people, parallels it with a skip trail which stops only on the salient items, and can follow at any time contemporary trails which lead him all over civilization at a particular epoch. There is a new profession of trail blazers, those who find delight in the [task](<task.md>)

- attempting to begin [task](<task.md>)

- important [task](<task.md>)s

- When a new [task](<task.md>)

- [A](<A.md>) : [task](<task.md>)

- [B](<B.md>) : [task](<task.md>)

- Begin Immediately and Persist Until the [task](<task.md>)

- Once you know the highest-value [task](<task.md>),

- Take action on the most important [task](<task.md>)

- Once you start, keep working to full completion ([task](<task.md>)

- Most identifiable sign of high-performing people is action-orientation, they are in a hurry to complete key [task](<task.md>)s

- Set deadlines (and sub-deadlines as appropriate) for every [task](<task.md>)

- Determine how many minutes/hours each [task](<task.md>)

- Set aside 30/60/90 minute blocks for important [task](<task.md>)s

- Use transition periods (“gifts of time”) to complete small steps in larger [task](<task.md>)s

- The more accurate your answers are to these questions, the easier it will be to set priorities and do the most valuable [task](<task.md>)

- A handful of your [task](<task.md>)s

- Completing high-value [task](<task.md>)s

- Continually review responsibilities to identify [task](<task.md>)s

- There is always a rate-limiting step in every [task](<task.md>)

- What holds you back from doing the most important [task](<task.md>)s

- Clear everything off your desk until only the [task](<task.md>)

- Have everything you need to complete [task](<task.md>)

- Three core [task](<task.md>)s

- Make a list of important output responsibilities, [task](<task.md>)s

- Utilize the specific time of the day when you are at your best for top-priority [task](<task.md>)s

## [GTD](<GTD.md>)
- Allen states that the brain goes through five steps to accomplish most any [task](<task.md>)

- if you can get all of your commitments out of your head, and into an [Exo-Brain](<Exo-Brain.md>) you trust -- tool doesn't matter -- so you know you'll remember the [task](<task.md>)

## [Just in Time Project Management](<Just in Time Project Management.md>)
- This refers to the balance between how challenging a [task](<task.md>)

- "Licklider's analysis of his research behavior showed that most of his [task](<task.md>)s

## [Roam White Paper](<Roam White Paper.md>)
Besides reasoning and argument, dependency graphs have applications in education, self-directed learning, and general decision-making. Even a very complicated project can be traced backwards to a number of smaller [task](<task.md>)s

- For most people, the problem of sorting signal from noise therefore involves finding trustworthy and accurate secondary sources of information. This difficult [task](<task.md>)

## [Roam for Zettlekasting](<Roam for Zettlekasting.md>)
If you want to try out Roam for organizing your thoughts, [task](<task.md>)s

## [What People Are Saying](<What People Are Saying.md>)
For me, **Roam is the productivity tool that I didn't know I needed**. It took about a day of getting used to before I instantly adopted it into my daily regimen. **I used to use a combination of written daily planners, Evernote, Wunderlist, Google drive, and Microsoft Office to record my thoughts, [task](<task.md>)s

- [Roam] gives us structure and ability to track [task](<task.md>)s

- For the last few weeks we've been testing a new tool for [task](<task.md>)

- For the last few weeks we've been testing a new tool for [task](<task.md>) management and bug tracking at Radix Motion. We've previously tried Asana and Notion and this works a lot better for us. It gives us structure and ability to track [task](<task.md>)s

- If we want to improve on the iteration speed in scientific research, one of the more promising ways would be to incorporate methods from software engineering. Software engineering has gone from waterfall projects that release updates as standalone monoliths from a closed-source warehouse, to agile-developed remotely-updated differential improvements that may be supported a large community. Academic literature by contrast is still structured as it was in the early days of physical publishing, and has barely adapted (and this is putting it extremely kindly) for [task](<task.md>)s
