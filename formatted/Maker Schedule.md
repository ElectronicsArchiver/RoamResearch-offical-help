Making needs 4 hour chunks because anything less tends to increase entropy rather than decrease it in any non-trivial knowledge work project.

- see also "Breaking our work into smaller chunks directly creates the conditions for flow. Smaller packets dramatically impact not just the quantity and speed of work we can produce, and not just its quality, but the actual experienceof producing it. Work becomes more motivating, more meaningful, easier, more impactful, and more engaging. #[Maker Schedule](<Maker Schedule.md>)"

- If we see our work as creating these [Intermediate Packets](<Intermediate Packets.md>), we can find ways to create value in any span of time, no matter how short. Productivity becomes a game of matching each available block of time (or state of mind, or mood, or energy level) with a corresponding packet that is perfectly suited to it. #[Maker Schedule](<Maker Schedule.md>)

- As you offload more and more of your abstract thinking to external tools, new bandwidth begins to open up. This leaves room for noticing your surroundings, the words and actions of others, new sensory experiences, and internal states and bodily sensations. Outsourcing your memory to software frees you up to be present in the moment. #[Maker Schedule](<Maker Schedule.md>)
