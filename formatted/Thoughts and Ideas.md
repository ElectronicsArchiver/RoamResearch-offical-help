## [March 16th, 2020](<March 16th, 2020.md>)
- [Thoughts and Ideas](<Thoughts and Ideas.md>)

- The problem right now - conceptually - is that when I block ref something - I've been defaulting to thinking about referencing the LINK -- like - the whole connection between "[Thoughts and Ideas](<Thoughts and Ideas.md>)"
